## Takes the tedium out of preparing for a concert  
Playlist Builder is a Java/Spring Boot application that uses the Setlist.fm and Spotify APIs to build playlists from a given setlist.  
While growing up, my father and I always had a copy of a band's setlist to get excited and prep for an upcoming concert. I decided to lean into that idea by using some APIs to bring it to the modern age. Instead of filtering through a discography and burning a cd, it's done with a copy/pasted link and a couple button clicks.
